| `app-healthcheck:0.11.0`      | Container image for app                                                 |
| `app-healthcheck:0.11.0_base` | Base container image for app.  Requires SpaceSDK_Base and build service |

## Building

1. Provision /var/spacedev

    ```bash
    # clone the azure-orbital-space-sdk-setup repo and provision /var/spacedev
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/azure-orbital-space-sdk-setup
    cd azure-orbital-space-sdk-setup
    bash ./.vscode/copy_to_spacedev.sh
    cd -
    ```

1. Build the nuget packages and the container images.

    ```bash
    # clone this repo
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/azure-orbital-space-sdk-app-healthcheck

    cd azure-orbital-space-sdk-app-healthcheck

    # Trigger the build_app.sh from azure-orbital-space-sdk-setup
    /var/spacedev/build/dotnet/build_app.sh \
        --repo-dir ${PWD} \
        --app-project dotnet-src/app-healthcheck.csproj \
        --architecture amd64 \
        --output-dir /var/spacedev/tmp/app-healthcheck \
        --app-version 0.11.0 \
        --annotation-config azure-orbital-space-sdk-app-healthcheck.yaml \
        --no-push
    ```

1. Copy the build artifacts to their locations in /var/spacedev

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /var/spacedev/yamls/apps/app-healthcheck

    sudo cp ./schedules/* /var/spacedev/yamls/apps/app-healthcheck/
    ```

1. Push the artifacts to the container registry. Perform the same steps for building in arm64, but replace with `--architecture arm64`.

    ```bash
    # Push the yamls and schedules to the container registry
    while read -r appFile; do
        /var/spacedev/build/push_build_artifact.sh \
            --artifact "${appFile}" \
            --annotation-config azure-orbital-space-sdk-app-healthcheck.yaml \
            --architecture amd64 \
            --artifact-version 0.11.0
    done < <(find "/var/spacedev/yamls/apps/app-healthcheck/" -type f)



    ```
